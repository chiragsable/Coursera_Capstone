# London vs New York? What is your choice? Let the data decide!

***NYC*** *and **London** are the two most important metro cities and the financial centers of their respective country in the world. So, there is a competition among the cities as in which city is the most perfect city. Also the tourism sector of both these cities is very strong. There has been a war for supremacy in terms of quality of life, jobs, education, entertainment and recreational facilities that these cities have to offer to its residents.*

*This project attempts to analyze the neighborhoods in each of these two cities and tries to understand what is popular in them and what they have to offer to someone who is contemplating to make a choice on seeking a life in either of the metro cities.*
