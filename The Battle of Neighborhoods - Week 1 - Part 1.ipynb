So, there is a competition among the cities as in which city is the most perfect city. Also the tourism sector of both these cities is very strong. There has been a war for supremacy in terms of quality of life, jobs, education, entertainment and recreational facilities that these cities have to offer to its residents. \n\nThe deciding factor for most would be on how lively, supportive, vibrant and unique each of the cities can be when compared to each other. Now, say you are a non-resident of these cities. Some day you plan to visit these cities. It is quite obvious that if you are planning to visit any new city you would first consider that what does this city has to offer me? Alright. So, you would like to know about the famous places to visit, the best foods to try, etc. This is the problem which will be addressed in this project wherein we will be comparing the two cities (NYC and London) and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. This project attempts to analyze the neighborhoods in each of these two cities and tries to understand what is popular in them and what they have to offer to someone who is contemplating to make a choice on seeking a life in either of the metro cities.  \n"
